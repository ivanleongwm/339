	abstract = {Real estate is a favored investment option as it allows investors to diversify their portfolios and minimize risk. Investors can invest in real estate directly by purchasing a property, or through real estate investment funds (REITs) where they can purchase shares in companies that own and manage real estate. Investing in REITs has become increasingly popular because it eliminates some of the disadvantages associated with direct real estate investment, such as the need for a large upfront payment. When investing in mixed asset portfolios, it is crucial to predict future prices accurately to ensure profitable and less risky asset allocation. However, literature on price prediction often focuses on only one or two algorithms, and there is no research that explores REITs’ price prediction in the context of portfolio optimization. To address this gap, we conducted a thorough evaluation of 5 machine learning algorithms (ML), including Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), k-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long/Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM), as well as other financial benchmarks like Holt’s Exponential Smoothing (HES), Trigonometric Seasonality, Box–Cox Transformation, ARMA Errors, Trend, and Seasonal Components (TBATS), and Auto-Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We applied these algorithms to predict future prices for 30 REITs from the US, UK, and Australia, as well as 30 stocks and 30 bonds. The assets were then used as part of a portfolio, which we optimized using a genetic algorithm. Our results showed that using ML algorithms for price prediction provided at least three times the return over benchmark models and reduced risk by almost two-fold. For REITs, we observed that the use of ML algorithms led to a higher allocation to REITs diversified by country. In particular, our results showed that SVR was the best-performing algorithm in terms of risk-adjusted returns across different time horizons, as confirmed by our Friedman test results (Sharpe ratio). Overall, our study highlights the effectiveness of ML algorithms in predicting asset prices and optimizing portfolio allocation.},

We then propose and implement a model for testing whether differences in asset structure, financial leverage, management strategy, and degree of specialization in the REIT portfolios are related to their sensitivity to interest rate and market risk.

To this end, we employ several forecasting models to test for REITs predictability under a flexible framework that captures parameter instability. Apart from the traditional factors examined in relevant studies, we also account for a series of sentiment and uncertainty indicators that may be significant predictors of REITs returns, especially during turbulent times when sentiment determines investment decisions to a greater extent. The empirical results indicate that the good predictors of REITs returns vary over time and over the forecast horizons. Our results suggest that economy-wide indicators, monetary policy instruments and sentiment indicators are among the most powerful predictors of REITs returns. In economic terms, an investment strategy that is based on our forecasts outperforms a buy and hold strategy. The issue of the most suitable forecasting method is also discussed in detail. Our results might entail implications for investors and market authorities.},

	abstract = {Real estate investment trust (REIT) stock prices deviate substantially from net asset values (NAV). Using REIT data since 1990, we find large positive excess returns to a strategy of buying stocks that trade at a discount to NAV, and shorting stocks trading at a premium to NAV. Estimated alphas from this strategy are between 0.9\% and 1.8\% per month, with little risk. Trading costs and short-sale constraints are not prohibitive and the results strengthen when we control for differences in liquidity or the extent of institutional ownership. We find that some variation in P/NAV makes sense, as premiums are positively related to recent and future NAV growth. However, there appears to be too much volatility in P/NAV, giving rise to potential profits from short-term mean reversion. The closed-end fund literature has some similar findings on stock price deviations from fundamental value, but compared to closed-end funds REITs are much larger and have much higher insider and institutional ownership. These differences suggest that REIT premiums and discounts reflect more than just small investor sentiment, which is a common explanation of why closed-end fund prices deviate from their fundamental value.},

The imported data were chosen technical indicators highly regarded by stock analysts, each represented by 4 input variables that were based on past time spans of 4 different lengths: 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-day spans before the day of prediction. This import undertaking generated a big set of diverse input variables with an exponentially higher number of possible subsets that GA culled down to a manageable number of more effective ones. SET50 index data of the past 6 years, from 2009 to 2014, were used to evaluate this hybrid intelligence prediction accuracy, and the hybrid’s prediction results were found to be more accurate than those made by a method using only one input variable for one fixed length of past time span.},

In our study, we consider four international stock indices that follow the concept of distributed lag analysis. We adopted a genetic algorithm approach to select a set of helpful features among these lags’ indices. Subsequently, we employed the Random Forest classifier, to unveil hidden relationships between stock indices and a particular stock’s trend. We tested our model by using it to predict the trends of 15 stocks. Experiments showed that our forecasting model had 80\% accuracy, significantly outperforming the dummy forecast. The S\&P 500 was the most useful stock index, whereas the CAC40 was the least useful in the prediction of daily stock trends.

	abstract = {Portfolio optimization has been a central problem in finance, often approached with two steps: calibrating the parameters and then solving an optimization problem. Yet, the two-step procedure sometimes encounter the "error maximization" problem where inaccuracy in parameter estimation translates to unwise allocation decisions. In this paper, we combine the prediction and optimization tasks in a single feed-forward neural network and implement an end-to-end approach, where we learn the portfolio allocation directly from the input features. Two end-to-end portfolio constructions are included: a model-free network and a model-based network. The model-free approach is seen as a black-box, whereas in the model-based approach, we learn the optimal risk contribution on the assets and solve the allocation with an implicit optimization layer embedded in the neural network. The model-based end-to-end framework provides robust performance in the out-of-sample (2017-2021) tests when maximizing Sharpe ratio is used as the training objective function, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.16 when nominal risk parity yields 0.79 and equal-weight fix-mix yields 0.83. Noticing that risk-based portfolios can be sensitive to the underlying asset universe, we develop an asset selection mechanism embedded in the neural network with stochastic gates, in order to prevent the portfolio being hurt by the low-volatility assets with low returns. The gated end-to-end with filter outperforms the nominal risk-parity benchmarks with naive filtering mechanism, boosting the Sharpe ratio of the out-of-sample period (2017-2021) to 1.24 in the market data.},

This GP model retains the inductive biases of the stochastic volatility model while providing the posterior predictive distribution given by GP inference. Within this framework, we take inspiration from well studied domains to introduce a new class of models, Volt and Magpie, that significantly outperform baselines in stock and wind speed forecasting, and naturally extend to the multitask setting.},

	abstract = {Integrating return prediction of traditional time series models in portfolio formation can improve the performance of original portfolio optimization model. Since machine learning and deep learning models have shown overwhelming superiority than time series models, this paper combines return prediction in portfolio formation with two machine learning models, i.e., random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), and three deep learning models, i.e., LSTM neural network, deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP) and convolutional neural network. To be specific, this paper first applies these prediction models for stock preselection before portfolio formation. Then, this paper incorporates their predictive results in advancing mean–variance (MV) and omega portfolio optimization models. In order to present the superiority of these models, portfolio models with autoregressive integrated moving average’s return prediction are used as benchmarks. Evaluation is based on historical data of 9 years from 2007 to 2015 of component stocks of China securities 100 index. Experimental results show that MV and omega models with RF return prediction, i.e., RF+MVF and RF+OF, outperform the other models. Further, RF+MVF is superior to RF+OF. Due to the high turnover of these two models, this paper discusses their performance after deducting the transaction fee cased by turnover. Experiments present that RF+MVF still performs the best among MVF models and omega model with SVR prediction (SVR+OF) performs the best among OF models. Moreover, RF+MVF performs better than SVR+OF and high turnover erodes nearly half of their total returns especially for RF+OF and RF+MVF. Therefore, this paper recommends investors to build MVF with RF return prediction for daily trading investment.},

Motivated by these advancements, there has been a surge of interest among researchers to harness the capabilities of GPT-4 for the automated design of quantitative factors that do not overlap with existing factor libraries, with an aspiration to achieve alpha returns {\textbackslash}cite\{webpagequant\}. In contrast to these work, this study aims to examine the fidelity of GPT-4's comprehension of classic trading theories and its proficiency in applying its code interpreter abilities to real-world trading data analysis. Such an exploration is instrumental in discerning whether the underlying logic GPT-4 employs for trading is intrinsically reliable. Furthermore, given the acknowledged interpretative latitude inherent in most trading theories, we seek to distill more precise methodologies of deploying these theories from GPT-4's analytical process, potentially offering invaluable insights to human traders. To achieve this objective, we selected daily candlestick (K-line) data from specific periods for certain assets, such as the Shanghai Stock Index. Through meticulous prompt engineering, we guided GPT-4 to analyze the technical structures embedded within this data, based on specific theories like the Elliott Wave Theory. We then subjected its analytical output to manual evaluation, assessing its interpretative depth and accuracy vis-{\textbackslash}`a-vis these trading theories from multiple dimensions. The results and findings from this study could pave the way for a synergistic amalgamation of human expertise and AI-driven insights in the realm of trading.},

	abstract = {Portfolio management is the task of constantly redistributing the wealth of an investor into different financial products known as assets in order to maximize the overall profit during the trading period while maintaining an acceptable level of risk. Traditionally, this problem has been heavily studied using a static approach, leading to the creation of what is known as the Modern Portfolio Theory by economist H. Markowitz in 1952. However, more recent developments in the field of optimization of dynamical systems, especially via reinforcement learning, have sparked a growing interest in applying these new techniques to the portfolio optimization task.    In this thesis, we represent the trading environment as a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system and apply deep learning based reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent to learn a trading strategy that optimizes a given objective. In particular, we assume that the agent has information only on the daily open, high, low and close prices and the trading volumes and, using these values, the trading agent has to decide, at the end of every trading day, what portfolio to build for the next day, keeping into account that all transactions are penalized due to the presence of a transaction cost equal to a small percentage of the total transaction value.    Regarding the reinforcement learning algorithms employed, we focused only on actor-critic methods using LSTM-based architectures to represent the value and policy functions. These techniques are further improved via a pre-training step by initializing the networks weights using the optimal weights obtained by training a network with the same structure to forecast portfolio returns.    Multiple experiments done using real market data consisting of a small set of stocks chosen from those included in the S\&P500 index show the validity of applying the reinforcement learning framework to the task of portfolio optimization.},

Tarkoituksena on luoda DRL-agentti, joka pystyy rakentamaan ja hallitsemaan itsenäisesti osakesalkkua analysoimalla julkisten yhtiöiden päivittäistä tuottoa, Earnings to price-tunnuslukua, osinkotuottoa sekä kaupankäyntimääriä.  
Tutkimuksen datana käytettiin vuoden 2013 tammikuun S\&P500-indeksin osakkeita vuosilta 1998-2018, joista oli jätetty pois vuoden 2004 jälkeen listautuneet yhtiöt (84).  Käymällä kauppaa jäljellä olevilla 416 osakkeella, tutkimuksessa kehitetty agentti pystyi kasvattamaan salkun riskikorjattua tuottoa yli indeksin sekä kaikkien vertailuportfolioiden, saavuttaen 329\% tuoton 5 vuoden testijakson aikana. Osakkeiden kaupankäyntimäärät todettiin tutkimuksessa agentin suorituskyvyn kannalta hyödyttömäksi lähtötiedoksi. Agentin osoitettiin parantavan merkittävästi osakeportfolion riskikorjattua sekä kokonaistuottoa, mutta sen kaupankäyntistrategian todettiin olevan ennemmin opportunistinen, kuin jatkuvaan ylituottoon kykenevä. 
Saavutetuista ylituotoista huolimatta, agentin ei kuitenkaan osoitettu ylittävän tilastollisesti merkitsevästi markkinatuottoa. Tulokset tukevat aiempia havaintoja syvän vahvistusoppimisen sovellettavuudesta salkunhoidossa.},

The success of a multi-factor model is largely determined by the effectiveness of the alpha factors used in the model. This paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm called AutoAlpha to automatically generate effective formulaic alphas from massive stock datasets. Specifically, first we discover an inherent pattern of the formulaic alphas and propose a hierarchical structure to quickly locate the promising part of space for search. Then we propose a new Quality Diversity search based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA-QD) to guide the search away from the well-explored space for more desirable results. Next, we utilize the warm start method and the replacement method to prevent the premature convergence problem. Based on the formulaic alphas we discover, we propose an ensemble learning-to-rank model for generating the portfolio. The backtests in the Chinese stock market and the comparisons with several baselines further demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoAlpha in mining formulaic alphas for quantitative trading.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we develop a comprehensive account of the expressive power, modelling efficiency, and performance advantages of so-called trading agents (i.e., Deep Soft Recurrent Q-Network (DSRQN) and Mixture of Score Machines (MSM)), based on both traditional system identification (model-based approach) as well as on context-independent agents (model-free approach). The analysis provides conclusive support for the ability of model-free reinforcement learning methods to act as universal trading agents, which are not only capable of reducing the computational and memory complexity (owing to their linear scaling with the size of the universe), but also serve as generalizing strategies across assets and markets, regardless of the trading universe on which they have been trained. The relatively low volume of daily returns in financial market data is addressed via data augmentation (a generative approach) and a choice of pre-training strategies, both of which are validated against current state-of-the-art models. For rigour, a risk-sensitive framework which includes transaction costs is considered, and its performance advantages are demonstrated in a variety of scenarios, from synthetic time-series (sinusoidal, sawtooth and chirp waves), simulated market series (surrogate data based), through to real market data (S{\textbackslash}\&P 500 and EURO STOXX 50). The analysis and simulations confirm the superiority of universal model-free reinforcement learning agents over current portfolio management model in asset allocation strategies, with the achieved performance advantage of as much as 9.2{\textbackslash}\% in annualized cumulative returns and 13.4{\textbackslash}\% in annualized Sharpe Ratio.},

An important aspect of this process is to be able to forecast future REITs prices, as this allows investors to achieve higher returns at lower risk. This paper examines the performance of five different machine learning algorithms in the task of REITs price forecasting: Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Long/Short-Term Memory Neural Networks. In addition to past REITs prices, we also use Technical Analysis indicators to assist the algorithms in the task of price prediction. While such indicators are very popular in stocks forecasting, they have never been used to forecast REITs. Our experiments show that (i) all ML algorithms produce low error and standard deviation, and are able to outperform the well-known statistical benchmark of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and (ii) the introduction of Technical Analysis (TA) indicators into the feature set leads to an error reduction of up to 50\%.},

            This article presents findings of a questionnaire and an interview survey on the perceived importance of chartist/technical and fundamental analysis among foreign exchange traders and financial journalists in Frankfurt, London, Vienna, and Zurich. Results confirm that most traders use both forecasting approaches, and that the shorter the forecasting horizon, the more important chartist/technical analysis is. Financial journalists put more emphasis on fundamental analysis than do foreign exchange traders. Results indicate that the importance of chartism may have increased over the last decade. Regarding the use of chartist/technical and fundamental analysis on seven forecasting horizons, four distinct clusters of traders can be identified. Forecasting styles and the overall importance attached to fundamental versus chartist/technical analysis vary across different trading locations. Foreign exchange traders mention a series of psychological motives and consequences of the use of chartism. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Investors in the stock market have always been in search of novel and unique techniques so that they can successfully predict stock price movement and make a big profit. However, investors continue to look for improved and new techniques to beat the market instead of old and traditional ones. Therefore, researchers are continuously working to build novel techniques to supply the demand of investors. Different types of recurrent neural networks (RNN) are used in time series analyses, especially in stock price prediction. However, since not all stocks’ prices follow the same trend, a single model cannot be used to predict the movement of all types of stock’s price. Therefore, in this research we conducted a comparative analysis of three commonly used RNNs—simple RNN, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)—and analyzed their efficiency for stocks having different stock trends and various price ranges and for different time frequencies. We considered three companies’ datasets from 30 June 2000 to 21 July 2020. The stocks follow different trends of price movements, with price ranges of \$30, \$50, and \$290 during this period. We also analyzed the performance for one-day, three-day, and five-day time intervals. We compared the performance of RNN, LSTM, and GRU in terms of R2 value, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE metrics. The results show that simple RNN is outperformed by LSTM and GRU because RNN is susceptible to vanishing gradient problems, while the other two models are not. Moreover, GRU produces lesser errors comparing to LSTM. It is also evident from the results that as the time intervals get smaller, the models produce lower errors and higher reliability.},

	abstract = {Application of machine learning for stock prediction is attracting a lot of attention in recent years. A large amount of research has been conducted in this area and multiple existing results have shown that machine learning methods could be successfully used toward stock predicting using stocks’ historical data. Most of these existing approaches have focused on short term prediction using stocks’ historical price and technical indicators. In this paper, we prepared 22 years’ worth of stock quarterly financial data and investigated three machine learning algorithms: Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), Random Forest (RF) and Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for stock prediction based on fundamental analysis. In addition, we applied RF based feature selection and bootstrap aggregation in order to improve model performance and aggregate predictions from different models. Our results show that RF model achieves the best prediction results, and feature selection is able to improve test performance of FNN and ANFIS. Moreover, the aggregated model outperforms all baseline models as well as the benchmark DJIA index by an acceptable margin for the test period. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning models could be used to aid fundamental analysts with decision-making regarding stock investment.},

	abstract = {We examine the efficacy of machine learning in one of the most important tasks in fundamental analysis, forecasting corporate earnings. We find that machine learning models, especially those accommodating nonlinearities, generate significantly more accurate and informative forecasts than a host of state-of-the-art earnings prediction models in the extant literature. Further analysis suggests that machine learning models uncover economically sensible relationships between historical financial information and future earnings, and the new information uncovered by machine learning models is of considerable economic significance. The new information component is significantly associated with both future stock returns and analyst forecast errors, with stocks in the quintiles with the most favorable new information outperforming those in the least favorable quintiles by approximately 70 bps per month. The overall results suggest that limiting to linear relationships and aggregated accounting numbers substantially understates the decision usefulness of financial statement information to investors.},
